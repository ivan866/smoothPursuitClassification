---------------

What's new?
- Repository started at gitlab.com/ivan866/smoothPursuitClassification
- Mirrored at github.com/ivan866/smoothPursuitClassification
- New feature: 3 smoothing variants implemented: savgol, spline, conv
- New feature: velocity calculated as spherical eye model
- New feature: I-VT event detector
- New feature: I-BDT classifier
- New feature: I-VT classifier uses velocity calculated by one of three smooth algorithms, thus results of detection differ
- New feature: debug log
- Dependencies added: scipy>=1.0.0, numpy, pandas>=0.21.1, opencv-python, eyestudio, angles

Known bugs:
- Events classified by I-BDT are not filtered by minimum duration
- I-BDT classifier does not use angular velocity, uses simple distance/time instead
- No neural net classifiers implemented
- Tobii data not supported yet
- Tagging data stream on trials and messages is not implemented yet
- No plotting inside main script implemented
